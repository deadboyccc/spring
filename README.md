# Spring API Exploration Hub

**In a nutshell:**
A personal sandbox for experimenting with different API paradigms (REST, gRPC, SOAP, GraphQL), Spring features (data, security, AOP, testing, etc.), integration/messaging, and Dockerization—built purely for hands‑on learning, not production.

---

## What This Hub Is For

- **Learning playground:** Tinker freely with each API style and core Spring capability.
- **Practical focus:** Emphasis on building solid **REST** and high‑performance **gRPC** services.
- **Breadth over polish:** Explore SOAP and GraphQL to see how they compare.

---

## Key Experiment Areas

### 1. API Styles
- **REST APIs:** Spring MVC or reactive WebFlux patterns.
- **gRPC services:** Fast binary RPC for microservices.
- **SOAP revisited:** Understand legacy XML‑based services.
- **GraphQL basics:** Flexible query patterns.

### 2. Integration & Messaging
- **In‑app communication:** Spring Integration or Cloud Stream.
- **Message brokers:** Try Kafka or RabbitMQ for async flows.

### 3. Containerization
- **Dockerize it:** Package each service for easy, environment‑agnostic runs.
- **Portability mindset:** Learn container best practices.

### 4. Core Spring Deep Dives
- **Data access:**
  - Spring Data JPA (Hibernate)
  - JDBC Template for fine control
- **Fundamentals:** Dependency Injection & IoC
- **Cross‑cutting:** AOP for logging, security, etc.
- **Security:** Spring Security setups
- **Bootstrapping:** Spring Boot auto‑config magic
- **Web layers:** MVC or WebFlux, plus REST endpoints
- **App Context:** How beans are managed
- **Transactions:** Declarative TX boundaries
- **Testing:** JUnit + Mockito with Spring’s test support

## How to Use It

1. **Clone the repo.**
2. **Pick a module** (REST, gRPC, messaging, etc.).
3. **Run via Docker or locally.**
4. **Experiment freely**—break things, fix them, try new patterns.
5. **Read the docs** in each folder for setup and sample calls.

---

## Why This Exists

- **Curiosity‑driven:** A zero‑pressure space to try, fail, and learn.
- **Not production‑grade:** Focus is on exploration, not hardening.
- **Continual growth:** Add new experiments as Spring evolves.

---

> **Tip:** Treat each folder as its own mini‑tutorial—read its README, run the examples, then riff on them to discover how Spring’s pieces fit together.
